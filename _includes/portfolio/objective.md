I have three years of experience building apps for subject matter experts in neuroscience research:
  - User-friendly point-and-click interfaces
  - Interactive data visualizations
  - Predictive modeling
  - Automating and optimizing data processing pipelines

I am a software engineer sensitive to data science considerations and would like to continue to build and innovate, except for subject matter experts in industry.
