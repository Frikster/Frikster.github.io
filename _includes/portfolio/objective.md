Excellent set of inter-disciplinary skills related to performing quantitative and predictive analysis for neuroscience research and then designing data mining and data visualization applications that automate the analysis in a user-friendly way such that subject matter experts in neuroscience research can readily perform the analysis by themselves. Looking for industry opportunities that will put me on track to learn more about how to leverage GPU-accelerated parallel processing to solve/optimize machine learning problems to equip myself to implement apps to make machine learning more readily available to consumers.
