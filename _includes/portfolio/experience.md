## Research Assistant, Independent Consultant

- Developed an online R-Shiny application (called <a href="https://github.com/Frikster/URP-ShinyApp" target="_blank">URP-ShinyApp</a>) to make data mining and predictive modeling easier for subject matter experts in spinal cord clinical research 
  - Makes use of the R "party" package to implement a decision tree learning algorithm known as unbiased recursive partitioning for multivariate analysis
  - Used by the Vancouver General Hospital’s spinal cord clinic to assess a spinal cord injury patient’s eligibility for various clinical trial research settings
  - Extensively used by Prof. John Steeves, founding director of ICORD, to produce figures and reach conclusions

### Independent Consultant (2016 - Present)

- Providing statistical analysis and implementing modifications to URP-ShinyApp as requested for an international team of domain experts attempting to find standardized criteria for the enrollment of patients to nerve transfer surgery. Key collaborators include Ida Fox, Project lead and Associate Professor of Surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. 

### Research Assistant (2014 - 2016)

- Generated quality reports through data mining and statistical analysis using R and URP-ShinyApp to be used at conferences. Statistical techniques included power analysis and rasch models. 
- Part of an international team that established a working protocol for including spinal cord injury patients in clinical trials. Key collaborators include Prof. Armin Curt, Chief Consultant and Director of the Spinal Cord Injury Centre at Der Balgrist Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland and John Steeves.

## Research Assistant
- Designed and developed a user-friendly standalone cross-platform pyqt4/pyqtgraph (Python GUI frameworks) application (called <a href="https://github.com/Frikster/Mesoscale-Brain-Explorer" target="_blank">Mesoscale Brain Explorer</a>) for automating and standardizing analyses pipelines and visualization output, thereby making it easier for researchers without a background in programming to conduct their analysis. 
  - Used by three researchers, one who has used it extensively for seven months and continues to use it daily. 
  - Main subject of master’s thesis and peer-reviewed article published in *Neurophotonics*. 
- Developed Python scripts for automated neurophotonic data collection using Raspberry Pi coupled with the online data analytics tool Plotly and Bokeh for data visualization and lab reports. Provided evidence against a common assumption that the relationship between neurophotonic signal and light intensity is linear.
- Implemented and helped optimize the upload functionality of a neurophysiology data analytics website <a href="http://www.spikesortingtest.com/" target="_blank">SpikeSortingTest</a> using the Python web framework Django.
