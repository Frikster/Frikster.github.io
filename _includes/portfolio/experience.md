## Research Assistant
- Designed and developed a user-friendly standalone cross-platform pyqt4/pyqtgraph (Python GUI frameworks) application for automating and standardizing the analysis pipeline and visualization output required in TH Murphy's laboratory, thereby making it easier for researchers without a background in programming to conduct their analysis. Application continues to be used regularly by three researchers, one who has used it extensively for seven months and continues to use it daily.
- Developed Python scripts for automated neurophotonic data collection using Raspberry Pi coupled with the online data analytics tool Plotly and Bokeh for data visualization and lab reports. Provided evidence against a common assumption that the relationship between neurophotonic signal and light intensity is linear.
- Implemented and helped optimize the upload functionality of a neurophysiology data analytics website <a href="http://www.spikesortingtest.com/" target="_blank">SpikeSortingTest</a> using the Python web framework Django.

## Various Positions

- Developed an online R-Shiny application called URP-ShinyApp to make data mining and predictive modeling easier for subject matter experts in clinical research. The application makes use of the R "party" package to implement a decision tree learning algorithm known as unbiased recursive partitioning for multivariate analysis. Application continues to be used by the Vancouver General Hospital's spinal cord clinic to assess a spinal cord injury patient's eligibility for various clinical trial research settings. In particular, Prof. John Steeves, founding director of the International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries (ICORD), continues to use it extensively to produce figures and reach conclusions.

### Independent Consultant (2016 - Present)

- Part of an international team attempting to find standardized criteria for the enrollment of patients to nerve transfer surgery. Provide statistical analysis and implement feature requests to URP-ShinyApp as requested. Key collaborators include Ida Fox, Project lead and Associate Professor of Surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

### Programmer (2015)

- Part of an international team that established a working protocol for including spinal cord injury patients in clinical trials. Generated quality reports through decision tree learning and statistical analysis using R. Key collaborators include Prof. Armin Curt, Chief Consultant and Director of the Spinal Cord Injury Centre at Der Balgrist Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland and John Steeves.

### Research Assistant (2014 - 2016)

- Generated quality reports through data mining and statistical analysis using R and URP-ShinyApp to be used at conferences. Statistical techniques included power analysis and rasch models.
