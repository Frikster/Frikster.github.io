# Circuit Solver Android App  [![GitHub Repository]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/github.png)](https://github.com/Frikster/CircuitSolverApp)

{:.date}
9/16 - 12/16

As part of a team of 6, developed an Android application (Java):
- Uses OpenCV to process images of drawn circuits
- Uses TensorFlow model to recognize components found by OpenCV
- Uses Android NDK and NgSpice open source circuit simulator for solving the resultant circuit, given inputs
- Involved in all areas of development, heavily involved in unit testing (JUnit) and UI testing (Espresso)
- Project includes requirements, design and test plan documentation

# Towers VR [![GitHub Repository]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/github.png)](https://github.com/Frikster/BMEG554-Towers)

{:.date}
1/16 - 5/16

Developed a virtual reality (VR) environment using Unity3D and Leap Motion for a Biomedical Engineering self-directed study course (BMEG554) to explore the feasibility of using VR and Leap Motion in a clinical settings. <a href="http://icord.org/2016/05/30518/" target="_blank">Project outline</a>

# Four-Russians Speedup for RNA folding (Python)

{:.date}
2/14 - 5/14

Implemented (from conception to completion with a final grade of 100%) an O(n^3 / log(n))-time Algorithm for RNA folding using the Four-Russians Speedup (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2823755/" target="_blank">Relevant paper</a>) in collaboration with two partners. 

- Optimization techniques employed: memorization, using different packages and variable types, list comprehensions

# Prolog Clue

{:.date}
3/13 - 3/13

Developed a game (from scratch with a partner) to simulate a game of Clue. The program would play for a single player and keep a database of all moves other players make, store all known information, alert the player when a weapon, room or suspect is certain and provide a heuristic probability function that would suggest what the player should guess next based on what is currently known.

This was one of two term projects for CPSC 312: Functional and Logic Programming.

# Haskell Rush Hour

{:.date}
2/13 - 2/13

Developed a game (with templates given) to simulate graphically and solve a game of Rush Hour. This involves solving a combinatorial problem on a 2D matrix with an efficient algorithm.

This was one of two term projects for CPSC 312: Functional and Logic Programming.
