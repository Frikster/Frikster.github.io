# Mesoscale Brain Explorer  [![GitHub Repository]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/github.png)](https://github.com/Frikster/Mesoscale-Brain-Explorer)

{:.date}
6/16 - 8/17

Designed and developed a user-friendly standalone cross-platform pyqt4/pyqtgraph (Python GUI frameworks) application for automating and standardizing the analysis pipeline and visualization output required in TH Murphy's laboratory, thereby making it easier for researchers without a background in programming to conduct their analysis. Application continues to be used regularly by three researchers, one who has used it extensively for seven months and continues to use it daily.

# URP-ShinyApp [![GitHub Repository]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/github.png)](https://github.com/Frikster/URP-ShinyApp)

{:.date}
6/15 - 9/15

Developed an online R-Shiny application called URP-ShinyApp to make data mining and predictive modeling easier for subject matter experts in clinical research. The application makes use of the R "party" package to implement a decision tree learning algorithm known as unbiased recursive partitioning for multivariate analysis. Application continues to be used by the Vancouver General Hospital's spinal cord clinic to assess a spinal cord injury patient's eligibility for various clinical trial research settings. In particular, Prof. John Steeves, founding director of the International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries (ICORD), continues to use it extensively to produce figures and reach conclusions.

# Circuit Solver Android App  [![GitHub Repository]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/github.png)](https://github.com/Frikster/CircuitSolverApp)

{:.date}
9/16 - 12/16

As part of a team, developed an Android application (Java) that uses OpenCV to process images of drawn circuits, TensorFlow to recognize components found by OpenCV and Android NDK and NgSpice open source circuit simulator for solving the resultant circuit given particular inputs. Project includes requirements, design and test plan documentation.

# Towers VR [![GitHub Repository]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/github.png)](https://github.com/Frikster/BMEG554-Towers)

{:.date}
1/16 - 5/16

Developed a virtual reality (VR) environment using Unity3D and Leap Motion for a Biomedical Engineering self-directed study course (BMEG554) to explore the feasibility of using VR and Leap Motion in a clinical settings. <a href="http://icord.org/2016/05/30518/" target="_blank">Project outline</a>

# Four-Russians Speedup for RNA folding (Python)

{:.date}
2/14 - 5/14

Implemented (from conception to completion with a final grade of 100%) the Four-Russians Speedup for RNA folding in collaboration with two partners. The original (slower) Nussinov algorithm was also implemented and the runtimes vs RNA length for each was graphed, conclusively showing the speedup. The main reason for this project's difficulty is that speeding up the original algorithm was anything but trivial from a conceptual standpoint. We had to analyse and test the runtime of every bit of code so that we could identify any areas, however trivial, where we could use more efficient code (e.g. memorization, using different packages and variable types, list comprehensions etc.).

# Prolog Clue

{:.date}
3/13 - 3/13

Developed a game (from scratch with a partner) to simulate a game of Clue. The program would play for a single player and keep a database of all moves other players make, store all known information, alert the player when a weapon, room or suspect is certain and provide a heuristic probability function that would suggest what the player should guess next based on what is currently known.

This was one of two term projects for CPSC 312: Functional and Logic Programming

# Haskell Rush Hour

{:.date}
2/13 - 2/13

Developed a game (with templates given) to simulate graphically and solve a game of Rush Hour. This involves solving a combinatorial problem on a 2D matrix with an efficient algorithm
